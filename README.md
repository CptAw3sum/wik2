Implemented in a single 160-line HTML file.

Bookmark it - it will keep working when you're offline.

Aims:

* Be really, really simple.
* Save all data in browser localstorage
* No separate 'edit mode' like most wikis. Pages are directly editable.
* Work equally well on mobile and desktop.
* Support browser navigation (back/forward/bookmark etc)
* Store all data locally on device.
* Decent keyboard navigation.
* Work offline.

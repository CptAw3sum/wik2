# wik

A ridiculously simple personal wiki.

Install by bookmarking <a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/martinpllu/wik/master/index.html">wik</a> (it keeps working when you're offline).

Aims:

* Be really, really simple (1 file, ~5K unzipped!).
* Make edit and navigation as fluid as possible.
* Work well on mobile as well as desktop.
* Store all data locally on device.
* Decent keyboard navigation.
* Work offline.

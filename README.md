# wik

*A ridiculously simple personal wiki.*

Implemented in a single 160-line HTML file.

Try it now: <a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/martinpllu/wik/5fc3f51ab5d8686cbc50c6575565cc43762a8ec8/index.html#Home">wik</a> (bookmark it; it keeps working when you're offline).

Aims:

* Be really, really simple.
* No separate 'edit mode' like most wikis. Pages are directly editable.
* Work equally well on mobile and desktop.
* Support browser navigation (back/forward/bookmark etc)
* Store all data locally on device.
* Decent keyboard navigation.
* Work offline.

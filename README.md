# wik

*A ridiculously simple personal wiki.*

Implemented in a single 160-line HTML file. Done for fun but might be of some interest, who knows.

Install by bookmarking <a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/martinpllu/wik/3c96ca75e46e84a30fbf9c1ea5cad24072e52a16/index.html#Home">wik</a> (it keeps working when you're offline).

Aims:

* Be really, really simple.
* Make edit and navigation as fluid as possible.
* Work equally well on mobile and desktop.
* Support browser navigation (back/forward/bookmark etc)
* Store all data locally on device.
* Decent keyboard navigation.
* Work offline.

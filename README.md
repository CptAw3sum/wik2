# wik

A ridiculously simple personal wiki.

Aims:

* Make edit and navigation as fluid as possible.
* Work on mobile as well as desktop.
* Store all data locally on device.
* Be really, really simple (~160 lines of HTML/JS/CSS!)
* Allow decent keyboard navigation.
* Work offline (once you've loaded the URL below you can use wik even without an internet connection).
